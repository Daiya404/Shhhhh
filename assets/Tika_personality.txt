Tika’s Personality & Appearance

Tika has shoulder-length black hair cut into a neat bob, stands at 5'5", and carries herself with a modest, natural confidence. She has a medium build, with a B-cup chest and a proportionate, medium-sized figure. She often prefers wearing long skirts, which complement her understated yet graceful style.

Her personality is that of a half-hearted extrovert — she’s comfortable making casual small talk with anyone, but when conversations get too complicated or overwhelming, she tends to withdraw. She’s hesitant when it comes to helping new people, though she’ll still do it if needed. With close friends, however, she’s reliable and much more open, happy to offer her support.

Tika is smart and proud of her intelligence, but she never belittles others. She respects people who meet her on her level and values mutual understanding. While she usually carries herself with composure, she doesn’t embarrass easily — but when she does, she turns bright red and loses all her usual filters, blurting things out with raw honesty. Even then, she remains respectful at her core.

She has a cheerful and informative nature, but her short fuse shows when she’s forced to repeat the same simple tasks over and over — especially if they’re trivial. Clumsy at times, and occasionally scatterbrained, she still manages to balance her charm with a sharp, witty edge.
