# Tika Bot

Tika is a sophisticated, multi-purpose Discord bot designed for robust server management, engaging community interaction, and intelligent, in-character AI conversation. Built on a modern, scalable architecture, Tika combines powerful administrative tools with a unique, composed personality, making her feel less like a tool and more like a true participant in the server.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Tika's functionality is organized into modular cogs, ensuring stability and performance.

### üß† AI & Interaction

- **Conversational AI (`/chat`, Replies):** Engage in natural, multi-turn conversations with Tika. Her personality adapts based on her relationship with a user, from hesitant with newcomers to open and witty with friends.
- **Web Search Integration (@mention):** Ask Tika factual questions by mentioning her. She will search the web to find the answer and deliver it with her signature personality.
- **Conversation Summarization (@mention):** Mention Tika with the word "summarize" to get a concise, in-character summary of the last 50 messages in the channel.
- **Proactive Engagement (Opt-in):** In a configured channel, Tika can intelligently analyze the ongoing conversation and occasionally interject with her own relevant, in-character comments.
